### Mini Project Descriptions

1. Cleaning and analysing employee data: [Cleansing_and_analysing_employee_data.ipynb]()
Company XYZ recently migrated database systems causing some of the date_joined records to be NULL. It has been said that NULL records for date_joined fields indicates the employees joined prior to 2010. While investigating, you find out there are multiple employees with the same name and duplicate records for some employees. Write code to find the number of employees that joined each month. Can group all of the null values as Dec 1 2009
