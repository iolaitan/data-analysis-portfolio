# Itunu Olaitan - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi, I'm Itunu! This is a repository that I have created to showcase my skills from self-learning and track my progress in Data Analytics topic and skills fundamental to many data analyst roles.

## Projects

### Webscraping 
#### Scrape Property Listings
 - **Code**: [Webscraper_Tool_Zoopla.ipynb](https://github.com/iolaitan/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Webscraper%20Tool%20Zoopla%20.ipynb)

 - Used **Python BeautifulSoup** to collect property listing data from Zoopla. For my first attempt at webscraping, of the three most popular libraries used by developers in Python; Scrapy, Beautiful Soup and Selenium, I decided to use Beautiful Soup for this task as research shows it is easy to learn and can perform operations quickly up to a certain level of complexity. 

 - **Programming Language/Tools used**: Python, BeautifulSoup, pandas

 - **Skills**: Webscraping, Data Collection, HTML parsing






### Data Cleaning


#### Cleaning Airbnb Data for NYC
 - **Code**: [Data_Cleaning_NYC_Airbnb.ipynb](https://github.com/iolaitan/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Data_Cleaning_NYC_Airbnb/Data%20Cleaning%20Airbnb%20NYC.ipynb)

 - In this data cleaning project, I will clean the dataset by examining **missing values**, **duplicates**, **invalid/erroneous values**, fixing **datatypes**, **anomaly detection** and Y-variable cleaning methods (**Label encoding**, **dictionary mapping**, **one-hot encoding**).

 - **Programming Language/Tools used**: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

 - **Results**: Produced and exported a clean dataset that will be used in the next exploratory and visualisation steps




### Exploratory Data Analysis


#### EDA on Airbnb NYC data
 - **Code**: [Exploratory Data Analysis NYC Airbnb.ipynb](https://github.com/iolaitan/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20NYC%20Airbnb/Exploratory%20Descriptive%20Analysis%20Airbnb%20NYC.ipynb)

In this project I carry out **exploratory descriptive analysis** of the data in order to understand the dataset and form an **hypothesis** that can be useful for future decision making. This has been created in a simple and well-detailed structure that can be followed to carry out comprehensive analysis on data involved in any future study. This dataset includes all needed information to discover more about **hosts**, **geographical availability**, necessary metrics to draw conclusions.

Visualisations such as graphs are created using the **seaborn**. 


 - **Programming Language/Tools used**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
