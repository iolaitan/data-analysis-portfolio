#### Webscraping 
Code:

Description: In the UK housing market there has reportedly been a significant mismatch between the supply and demand where demand remains at strong levels and supply is still low. For this task I wanted scrape data from Zoopla to see how many properties are available within a given budget and criteria. For my first attempt at webscraping, of the three most popular libraries used by developers in Python; Scrapy, Beautiful Soup and Selenium, I decided to use Beautiful Soup for this task as research shows it is easy to learn and can perform operations quickly up to a certain level of complexity. I was able to scrape data as a compiled list as well as a table for analysis. 

Programming Language/Tools used: Python, Beautiful Soup, pandas

Skills: webscraping, lists, sets,
