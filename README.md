## Webscraping 
#### Scrape Property Listings
**Code**: [Webscraper_Tool_Zoopla.ipynb](https://github.com/iolaitan/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Webscraper%20Tool%20Zoopla%20.ipynb)

**Description**: Used **Python BeautifulSoup** to collect property listing data from Zoopla. For my first attempt at webscraping, of the three most popular libraries used by developers in Python; Scrapy, Beautiful Soup and Selenium, I decided to use Beautiful Soup for this task as research shows it is easy to learn and can perform operations quickly up to a certain level of complexity. 

**Programming Language/Tools used**: Python, BeautifulSoup, pandas

**Skills**: Webscraping
